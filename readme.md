## 🧭 Overview

**Prompt Engineering (PROMPT)** equips students with hands-on prompting techniques for different modalities: text, image, music, and video generation. Emphasis is placed on both _creative craft_ and _responsible use_.

Each week includes mini-projects that simulate real-world creative workflows, supported by ethical discussion and critical reflection.

## [🖼️ Day 01 — Prompting for Image & Video Generation](./day01.md)

**Focus:** Understanding visual generation models and mastering descriptive, stylistic prompting through the _Artistic Telephone_ game.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how text-to-image/video models interpret language.
- Construct scene-based prompts that define subject, style, and mood.
- Observe interpretation drift and prompt clarity in creative chains.

### Key Activities

- Model demo & style comparison (Replicate / SDXL / Pika Labs)
- Crafting effective art-style prompts
- Writing full visual scene descriptions
- _Artistic Telephone_ collaborative exercise

---

## [🎵 Day 02 — Prompting for Music & Sound Generation](./day02.md)

**Focus:** Exploring AI music and sound generation — prompting for genre, tempo, and mood across different models through the _PromptVision_ contest.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how AI systems synthesize and remix audio.
- Write structured prompts for mood, genre, and tempo.
- Evaluate and compare audio outputs for coherence and style.
- Collaborate in creative “AI Eurovision”-style performance.

## [💫 Day 03 — VibeCoding & Video Interpretation](./day03.md)

**Focus:** Translating aesthetic “vibes” into generative logic using **p5.js** and interpreting those human-coded rhythms through **AI video generation** inspired by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s _Internet_.

### Learning Goals

- Express mood, rhythm, and motion through parameter-based “vibe coding.”
- Understand how procedural systems embody aesthetic language.
- Generate visual outputs and transform them into AI video interpretations.
- Compare human vs. AI perception of visual rhythm and motion.

### Key Activities

- VibeCoding exercise in p5.js (no prior coding required)
- Group reinterpretations of _Internet_
- Frame capture and AI video generation on Replicate
- Reflection on motion, authorship, and interpretation drift
