## 🧭 Overview

**Prompt Engineering (PROMPT)** equips students with hands-on prompting techniques for different modalities: text, image, music, and video generation. Emphasis is placed on both *creative craft* and *responsible use*.

Each week includes mini-projects that simulate real-world creative workflows, supported by ethical discussion and critical reflection.

## 🖼️ Day 01 — Prompting for Image & Video Generation

**File:** [`day01.md`](./day01.md)
**Focus:** Understanding visual generation models and mastering descriptive, stylistic prompting through the *Artistic Telephone* game.

### Learning Goals

* Understand how text-to-image/video models interpret language.
* Construct scene-based prompts that define subject, style, and mood.
* Observe interpretation drift and prompt clarity in creative chains.

### Key Activities

* Model demo & style comparison (Replicate / SDXL / Pika Labs)
* Crafting effective art-style prompts
* Writing full visual scene descriptions
* *Artistic Telephone* collaborative exercise

## 🎵 Day 02 — Prompting for Music & Sound Generation

**File:** `day02.md` *(TBA)*
**Focus:** Exploring AI music and sound generation — prompting for genre, tempo, and mood across different models.

### Learning Goals

* Understand how AI systems synthesize and remix audio.
* Write structured prompts for mood, genre, and tempo.
* Evaluate and compare audio outputs for coherence and style.
