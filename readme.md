## üß≠ Overview

**Prompt Engineering (PROMPT)** equips students with hands-on prompting techniques for different modalities: text, image, music, and video generation. Emphasis is placed on both _creative craft_ and _responsible use_.

Each week includes mini-projects that simulate real-world creative workflows, supported by ethical discussion and critical reflection.

## üß© Competencies

**Professional**

- Design effective prompts for diverse AI tools and contexts.
- Adapt prompts to different models and use cases.
- Understand the limits and appropriate use of generative systems.
- Recognize privacy, security, and IP risks when using AI.

**Methodological**

- Test, compare, and refine prompts systematically.
- Analyze structure and wording to improve outputs.

**Personal**

- Engage critically and creatively with AI tools.
- Communicate transparently about AI-assisted work.
- Reflect on ethical and societal implications.

## [üñºÔ∏è Day 01 ‚Äî Prompting for Image & Video Generation](./day01.md)

**Focus:** Understanding visual generation models and mastering descriptive, stylistic prompting through the _Artistic Telephone_ game.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how text-to-image/video models interpret language.
- Construct scene-based prompts that define subject, style, and mood.
- Observe interpretation drift and prompt clarity in creative chains.

### Key Activities

- Model demo & style comparison (Replicate / SDXL / Pika Labs)
- Crafting effective art-style prompts
- Writing full visual scene descriptions
- _Artistic Telephone_ collaborative exercise

## [üéµ Day 02 ‚Äî Prompting for Music & Sound Generation](./day02.md)

**Focus:** Exploring AI music and sound generation ‚Äî prompting for genre, tempo, and mood across different models.

### Learning Goals

- Understand how AI systems synthesize and remix audio.
- Write structured prompts for mood, genre, and tempo.
- Evaluate and compare audio outputs for coherence and style.
