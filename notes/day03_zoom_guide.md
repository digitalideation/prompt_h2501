# 🧑‍💻 Day 03 — Zoom Facilitation Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

Support the *VibeCoding + AI Video* hybrid session when teaching fully online via Zoom. This guide ensures students can collaborate effectively even if they have no coding background.

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Pre-Class Setup

### 💻 Tools

* **Zoom** with Breakout Rooms enabled.
* **p5.js Web Editor** → [editor.p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org) (no installs needed).
* Prepare **3–4 starter sketches** with tweakable parameters (color, motion, density, etc.) and share the links in advance.
* Set up a **shared Google Drive folder or Padlet** for teams to upload screenshots or short loops.

### 🧠 Roles Overview

Send these before class:

| Role                       | Description                                          |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎛 **Tuner**               | Edits numbers or color values in code.               |
| 🎨 **Vibe Director**       | Describes aesthetic or emotional changes verbally.   |
| 🧠 **Observer / Recorder** | Takes notes, screenshots, or logs parameter changes. |

## 🧱 2️⃣ Sorting Students into Teams

### ⚡ Quick Skill Survey (5 min)

Ask in chat or poll:

> “Who feels comfortable changing small numbers or colors in code?”

* Raise hand → **Tuners**.
* Others → **Vibe Directors** or **Observers**.

### 🧭 Pairing

* Goal: **2–3 students per team** → 1 Tuner + 1 Director (+1 Observer optional).
* Assign each team to a **Breakout Room** (labeled *Team 1, Team 2…*).
* Share a specific **p5.js starter link** per room.
  Example:

  ```
  Team 1 → https://editor.p5js.org/yourname/sketches/vibe-A
  Team 2 → https://editor.p5js.org/yourname/sketches/vibe-B
  ```

## 🧪 3️⃣ Inside Breakout Rooms (~35 min)

**Team workflow:**

1. **Vibe Director:** Suggests changes (e.g. “make it calmer,” “add chaos,” “fade slowly”).
2. **Tuner:** Adjusts small parameters (numbers, colors, speed) accordingly.
3. **Observer:** Records changes and screenshots best frames.

💡 Encourage them to rename variables to match mood:

```js
let vibe = "calm waves";
let chaos = 0.3;
let colorShift = 0.02;
```

You (and any assistant) can rotate through rooms to provide help and inspiration.

---

## 📸 4️⃣ Collecting Results (10 min)

* Each team **exports 1–2 frames** via `File → Save Image` or screen capture.
* Upload to the shared Drive/Padlet folder.
* Optionally select 1 image per team to run through **Replicate video models** for short clips.

---

## 🪩 5️⃣ Main Room Showcase (15–20 min)

1. Return all to main room.
2. Share screen → cycle through team images or short clips.
3. Facilitate short feedback discussion:

   * “What visual element most affected the vibe?”
   * “Did it move the way you imagined?”
   * “Which aesthetic decisions surprised you?”

Optionally hold a quick poll:

* 💫 *Most Hypnotic Vibe*
* ⚡ *Best Chaos Energy*
* 🌿 *Most Organic Flow*

---

## 🧰 6️⃣ Facilitation Tips

* Encourage experimentation — no need to understand syntax.
* Emphasize iteration and description → *prompting, not coding.*
* If bandwidth issues occur, only the **Tuner shares screen** while others direct verbally.
* Keep extra starter links in the chat in case a sketch breaks.
* Record the showcase portion for reflection or documentation.

## ✅ Summary Workflow

| Step         | Action                      | Tool           |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- | :------------- |
| Skill survey | Identify Tuners & Directors | Zoom poll/chat |
| Form teams   | Assign Breakout Rooms       | Zoom rooms     |
| Create       | Edit shared sketches        | p5.js editor   |
| Collect      | Upload screenshots          | Drive / Padlet |
| Showcase     | Discuss results             | Zoom main room |

### ✨ Goal

Students experience the joy of *live, collaborative “prompting through code”*, even without coding skills, and see how descriptive language drives computational aesthetics.
