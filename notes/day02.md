# Teaching Notes ‚Äî Day 02 (Audio & Music Generation)

These notes support **Day 02: Prompting for Music & Sound Generation**. They include warm-up activities, prompt examples, and teaching cues for introducing audio generation tools and the _PromptVision_ contest.

## Block 1 ‚Äî Foundations & Demos

### Key Concepts Recap

- **How AI generates audio:** brief explanation of diffusion, autoregressive, and transformer-based models (e.g., MusicLM, Suno.ai, Udio).
- **Modalities:** text-to-music, text-to-sound, and audio-to-audio transformations.
- **Prompt anatomy:** genre ‚Üí mood ‚Üí tempo ‚Üí instrumentation ‚Üí structure ‚Üí vocal style.

**Talking Points:**

- AI music models operate like text-to-image systems but in the time‚Äìfrequency domain.
- Emphasize temporal composition: _describe progression or mood change over time_.
- Highlight ethical considerations (voice cloning, sampling, licensing).

### Quick Demo Ideas

1. **Genre variation demo:**

   - Prompt: `A calm ambient soundscape with ocean waves and slow synth chords.`
   - Modify: `A dark techno beat with ocean samples and metallic percussion.` ‚Üí compare rhythmic density and tone.

2. **Mood contrast:**

   - Prompt A: `An uplifting orchestral theme with brass fanfare and fast tempo.`
   - Prompt B: `A melancholic piano piece with sparse strings and slow tempo.`
   - Discuss: how prompt words like _uplifting_, _melancholic_, _fast_, _slow_ shape harmonic and rhythmic character.

3. **Instrument specificity:**

   - `A jazz trio with upright bass, brushed drums, and muted trumpet improvisation.`
   - `A synthetic pop track with electronic bass and vocoder vocals.`

### Optional Warm-Up Exercise

- Each student writes one prompt describing a 10-second soundscape.
- Instructor plays 3‚Äì4 outputs and asks the class: _Does the audio match the prompt‚Äôs tone and instrumentation?_

## Block 2 ‚Äî Tools & Prompt Craft

### Key Platforms to Showcase

| Type                | Tool                           | Strengths                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Text-to-Music**   | Suno.ai / Udio                 | High-quality multi-style songs with vocals.            |
| **Sound Design**    | Mubert / AudioCraft / AudioLDM | Great for ambient textures, SFX, and background loops. |
| **Composition Aid** | Soundful / Beatoven.ai         | Quick structure-based generation, easy iteration.      |

**Demonstration Flow:**

1. Show one identical prompt across two models (e.g., Udio vs. Suno) ‚Üí compare fidelity and style.
2. Discuss the difference between _composition-level_ vs. _texture-level_ control.

### Example Prompt Templates

- `A futuristic synthwave track at 110 BPM with arpeggiated bass and lush reverb.`
- `A cinematic trailer with strings, heavy percussion, and rising intensity.`
- `Lo-fi chillhop beat with vinyl crackle, warm piano chords, and laid-back tempo.`
- `Dark ambient drone with mechanical sounds and deep sub-bass.`

**Teaching Tip:** Encourage iteration ‚Äî changing one musical variable (tempo, mood, instrument) each time to observe the effect.

## Block 3 ‚Äî üé§ PromptVision: AI Song Contest

### Overview

Students participate in a _Eurovision-style contest_ to apply prompting skills collaboratively.

**Structure:**

- 6‚Äì7 teams (same group size as Day 01).
- Theme announcement at start (e.g., _Rebirth_, _Synthetic Love_, _Future Folk_).
- Each team generates one 30‚Äì60s track matching the theme.
- All tracks are played in sequence; teams vote on creativity and prompt design.

**Phases:**

1. **Theme reveal & brainstorming** ‚Äì 10 min
2. **Prompt crafting & generation** ‚Äì 40 min
3. **Submission & upload** ‚Äì 10 min
4. **Listening party & voting** ‚Äì 40 min
5. **Debrief** ‚Äì 10 min

**Voting Categories:**

- üèÜ Best Song (overall quality)
- üéß Best Prompt Concept (creative and clear)
- üé≠ Most Unexpected Genre Mix

### Teaching Tips

- Limit track length to keep the session on schedule.
- Encourage teams to articulate _why_ they chose specific prompt terms.
- For reflection, collect prompts privately (same rule as Day 01).
- Use a shared folder or Padlet board for track playback.

### Example Prompts for Contest Inspiration

- `A futuristic ballad about machines falling in love, 90 BPM, synthpop with vocoder vocals.`
- `A folk melody with AI choir singing in a fictional language, acoustic instruments, reverent mood.`
- `A chaotic drum & bass track symbolizing digital rebirth, 160 BPM, distorted samples.`

### Outcome for Day 02

After this session, students should be able to:

- Design prompts that control **genre, mood, and tempo**.
- Compare results across different music generation tools.
- Understand **prompt iteration** as compositional refinement.
- Critically evaluate creative and ethical aspects of AI-generated music.
