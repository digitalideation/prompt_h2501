# 🎲 Artistic Telephone — Class Flow (38 Students)

## 🧠 Goal

See how meaning, style, and composition drift as an image passes through six rounds of reinterpretation.

## 👥 Setup

- **6–7 groups** of **6 students** each (≈ 38 total).
- Each group forms a **circular chain** (S01 → S02 → S03 → S04 → S05 → S06 → S01).
- All students use the **same model** (e.g., _Stable Diffusion XL @ 512×512_ on Replicate).
- Each group has one **tech lead** to manage file naming and upload timing.
- Pre-made shared folders:

  ```
  /ArtisticTelephone/
     Group_A/
     Group_B/
     Group_C/
     ...
  ```

## 🕐 Timing Overview

| Stage | Activity                       | Duration  | Notes                                           |
| :---- | :----------------------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Explain rules & open folders   | 10 min    | Instructor demo + assign tech leads             |
| **2** | Round 1 – Prompt Creation      | 5 min     | Student 1 writes first prompt → generates image |
| **3** | Round 2 – Interpretation 1     | 5 min     | Student 2 guesses prompt from image → generates |
| **4** | Round 3 – Interpretation 2     | 5 min     | Student 3 repeats                               |
| **5** | Round 4 – Interpretation 3     | 5 min     | Student 4 repeats                               |
| **6** | Round 5 – Interpretation 4     | 5 min     | Student 5 repeats                               |
| **7** | Round 6 – Interpretation 5     | 5 min     | Student 6 repeats; chain complete               |
| **8** | Upload check & cleanup         | 10 min    | Verify all filenames / images                   |
| **9** | Gallery + lightning discussion | 15–20 min | Compare first vs. last images per chain         |

⏱️ **Total:** ~75–85 min
Use a **visible countdown timer** and announce each round clearly:

> “Time’s up! Pass your image clockwise!”

## 🗂️ File-Naming Convention

Keep order and lineage:

```
Group_A/
   01.png
   01_02.png
   01_02_03.png
   ...
   02.png
   02_03.png
   02_03_04.png
```

## 🧰 Prompts for Round 1 Starters

Each group begins with a **different theme word or concept** to seed diversity.
Suggested list:

1. _Serenity_
2. _Ritual_
3. _Metropolis_
4. _Decay_
5. _Connection_
6. _Chaos_
7. _Rebirth_

**Example starting prompt:**

> “At dawn, a monk performs a quiet ritual in a mountain temple courtyard, warm mist rising, cinematic light.”

## 💡 Instructor Tips

- Use the **same diffusion model** for everyone to reduce latency variance.
- Keep **resolution ≤ 1024 px**.
- Pre-load the Replicate model page before class; students should test one small run early.
- Display a live **progress tracker** (simple table on slide).
- Encourage **interpretive freedom** — students can change era, medium, or emotion.

## 🖼️ Gallery Wrap-Up

After all six images are complete:

1. Each group arranges their chain in one slide or Padlet row.
2. Compare first vs. last image — discuss:

   - What elements persisted (subject, color, framing)?
   - What drifted (style, emotion, narrative)?
   - How prompt clarity vs. creativity influenced outcomes.

3. Optional quick votes:

   - 🌀 _Most Surprising Transformation_
   - 🎨 _Best Stylistic Leap_
   - 📖 _Strongest Narrative Continuity_

## 🧩 Notes for the Instructor

- Assign one assistant or volunteer to monitor timing and file naming.
- Encourage students to observe _not just what changed_, but _why_ — what wording likely caused the shift.
- Remind them that **ambiguity breeds creativity** — misinterpretation is part of the design.

### ✅ Outcome

Students experience:

- The dynamics of visual interpretation drift.
- The importance of clarity and specificity in prompts.
- How style, composition, and mood evolve through iterative re-prompting.
