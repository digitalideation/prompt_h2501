# 🎤 PromptVision — Class Flow (38 Students)

## Goal

Create and perform a short AI-generated **song or sound composition** inspired by a shared theme, then compete in a _Eurovision-style contest_. Students learn to express genre, mood, and emotion through precise music prompting, and experience how creative constraints shape AI-generated sound.
